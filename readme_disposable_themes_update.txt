PHPVMS v7 Themes : Disposable & Disposable SideBar v1.02 UPDATE #1

* Installation
  If you have a default install of phpvsm just unzip the file at root folder of your phpvms install.
  Or just copy/upload the files manually over your files, accept overwrite when asked.

* SimBrief Form (flights/simbrief_form.blade.php)
  Form is now fully compatible with the latest dev build as of 24FEB21.
  Multiple fare types are now supported.
  Passenger planes can have a cargo fare too, form will calculate the passenger baggage weight
  and reduce it from the cargo capacity and use the remaining area for random cargo generation.

  Added transaction details

Safe flights and enjoy.
