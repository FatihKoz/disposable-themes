  If you have a default install of phpvsm just unzip the file at root folder of your phpvms install.
  Or just copy/upload the files manually over your files, accept overwrite when asked.

  Aircraft list will now display only aircraft at the departure airport
  This is controlled via admin/settings "Restrict Aircraft At Departure"

  Code cleanup for displayed fuel figures
